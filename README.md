# Project Overview
\
This project creates a discord bot which can be hosted via any cloud service (I had chosen Google Cloud). It can keep track of all suers in your server, and assign them ticket counts, which are then used to enter
raffles. The more tickets a user has, the more chance they have of winning. On top of this, the higher tier subscriber they are to the discord or to the twitch account the more chance they have. This bot also in the
future was going to have functions that allowed it to control overlays in my obs scenes so that interactive widgets on my stream could be controlled by users in discord.

## Installation
to run this bot yourself, just run
```
npm i | \ 
npm run dev
```
